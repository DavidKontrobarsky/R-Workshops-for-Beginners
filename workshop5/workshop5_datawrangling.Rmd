## Tidy data

### [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) ![](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png){width="10%" height="10%"}

The goal of `tidyr` is to **reshape** your **data** into **tidy** format.

1. Each variable is in a column.

2. Each observation is a row.

3. Each value is a cell.

![](images/tidy.png){width="100%"}
*The rules of tidy data, R for Data Science* <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html>

#### Why do we want tidy data?

If the data is arranged into a tidy format, the interesting bits easy to see.

Makes it easy to work with tidyverse packages that have been covered in earlier workshops.

#### Is our survey data tidy?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
survey <- read_csv("https://jiaying-wu.github.io/R-Workshops-for-Beginners/workshop5/survey_data.csv")
survey
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
survey <- read_csv("data/survey_data.csv")
survey
```

* What are the variables, observations and values?
* Are the variable names sensible?
* Are the data types correct (think about [last week's workshop](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/workshop4_datatype/))

#### Is this data tidy?
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
tourism <- read_csv("https://jiaying-wu.github.io/R-Workshops-for-Beginners/workshop5/data/tourism.csv")
tourism
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
tourism <- read_csv("data/tourism.csv")
tourism
```

#### Data in the wild

Find some data online, is it tidy?

Ideas:

* Data from the ABS
* Australian baby names

![Is the data world a utopia or distopia?](images/disutopia.jpg){width="50%"}

*Utopia/Distopia by [Dylan Glynn](https://web.archive.org/web/20130501081545/http://www.dylanglynn.com/utopia-dystopia/)*

### How do we make data tidy? ![](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png){width="6%" height="6%" float="right"}

#### Restructure the columns

* [`gather()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html): collapses multiple columns into two columns.

![](images/gather.gif){width="80%"}

* [`spread()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html): takes two columns, and spreads into multiple columns.

![](images/spread.gif){width="80%"}

*[gather() and spread() animations](https://github.com/apreshill/teachthat) by [Alison Hill](https://github.com/apreshill)*

```{r gather, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyr)
tourism <- tourism %>% 
  gather("State_Purpose", "Nights", -Year)
tourism
```

Is this tidy data now?

#### Split and combine columns

* [`separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html): splits a single column into several by some separator.

* [`unite()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/unite.html): combines multiple columns into one by some separator.

```{r separate, echo = TRUE}
tourism <- tourism %>% 
  separate(State_Purpose, into = c("State", "Purpose"), by = "_")
tourism
```

Is this tidy data now?

#### Data within data

* [`nest()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html): compact a section of data into a cell/value.

* [`unnest()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/unnest.html): expand a dataset into the original data.

```{r nest, echo = TRUE}
tourism <- tourism %>% 
  nest(Year, Purpose, Nights)
tourism
```

Is this tidy data now?

## Survey data

Before we start to analyse, download the following file from this website: http://bit.ly/MonashBA_R2

* Survey description

* Survey Data

Save it into the `data` subdirectory of your project.

![](images/Data_subdirectory.png){width="60%" height="60%"}

## Data manipulation

### [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) ![](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png){width="10%" height="10%"}

`dplyr` is a grammar of data manipulation, it provided a set of verbs that help you solve the common data manipulation challenges.

#### The survey data is tidy, but there is room for improvement!

```{r}
survey
```

* Column names are long and hard to code with.
* Some survey answers can be simplified.

Think about last week's [data types workshop](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/workshop4_datatype/).

![](images/spongebob-tidy.gif){width="50%"}

#### Simplifying the column names

* [`rename()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html): changes a name of a column.

```{r rename, echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
survey <- survey %>% 
  rename(
    uni_year = `Q1.What year of uni are you in?`,
    degree_type = `Q2.Do you study a single or double degree?`,
    travel_method = `Q3.Do you use public or private transport?`,
    travel_time = `Q4.How long does it take to come to uni? (Enter the number of minutes, as a number only.)`,
    hours_facebook = `Q5.Hours on facebook per week?(Enter a number only)`,
    hours_twitter = `Q6.Hours on Twitter? (Enter a number only)`,
    favourite_sport = `Q7.What is your favourite sport?`,
    superpower = `Q8.If you could have a super power what would it be?`,
    own_pets = `Q9.What pets do you have?`,
    class_days = `Q10.Which day you need to attend the class?`,
    like_cheese = `Q11.I like cheese.`,
    see_ausopen = `Q12.Have you been to the Australian Open?`,
    shirt_sizes = `Q13.Would you rather your shirts be always two sizes too big or one size too small?`,
    read_books = `Q14.How many books did you read last year?`
  )
survey
```

#### Thinking about data types

* [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html): adds or changes variables that are functions of existing variables.

##### Which questions have limited options?

```{r factor, echo = TRUE}
survey <- survey %>% 
  mutate(
    uni_year = factor(uni_year),
    degree_type = factor(degree_type),
    travel_method = factor(travel_method),
    see_ausopen = factor(see_ausopen),
    shirt_sizes = factor(shirt_sizes),
    read_books = ordered(read_books, levels = c("A. 0", "B. 1-5", "C. 6-10", "D. 10-20", "E. more than 20"))
  )
```

##### Which questions should be numbers?

Are they?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
survey$travel_time
survey$hours_facebook
survey$hours_twitter
```

Fixing the mess.

```{r number, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
survey <- survey %>% 
  mutate(
    travel_time = parse_number(travel_time),
    hours_twitter = parse_number(hours_twitter)
  )
```

Why don't we need to change the `hours_facebook` variable to a number?

##### Fixing the timestamp

```{r time, echo = TRUE}
library(lubridate)
survey <- survey %>% 
  mutate(
    Timestamp = ymd_hms(Timestamp, tz = "Australia/Melbourne")
  )
```

##### What should we do with `own_pets` and `class_days`?

Some ideas:

1. Leave them as they are?
2. Split them up into a nested list?

```{r nested, echo = TRUE}
library(stringr) # More on this later!
survey <- survey %>% 
  mutate(
    own_pets = str_split(own_pets, ";"),
    class_days = str_split(class_days, ";")
  )
```

### Ta-da!

![](images/simpsons-tidy.webp)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
survey
```

#### Now for some fun!

![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3ohuPwKuAoQYBgPEHK/giphy.gif)

(gif from https://giphy.com/explore/lets-have-some-fun)

#### Looking at certain observations

* [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html): picks cases based on their values.

![](images/filter.gif)

The rows which return `TRUE` will be kept in the data. So to keep only the people who like cheese:

```{r}
survey %>% 
  filter(like_cheese)
```

And to remove them, we can use `!` (NOT) to find people who do NOT like cheese (`!like_cheese`).

```{r}
survey %>% 
  filter(!like_cheese)
```

You can also make comparisons with `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`. You can combine comparisons with `|` (OR) and `&` (AND).

```{r}
survey %>% 
  filter(travel_method == "Public")
```

#### Sorting the data

* [`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html): changes the ordering of the rows.

The survey data is correctly ordered by the time of submission. Suppose we wanted to see who has the least travel time to uni?

```{r}
survey %>% 
  arrange(travel_time)
```

Hmm - a little suspicious. What about the longest travel time? Sort it in descending order with `desc()`!

```{r}
survey %>% 
  arrange(desc(travel_time))
```

We could of course also find the maximum using `filter()` - but be careful to remove the missing values.

```{r}
survey %>% 
  filter(travel_time == max(travel_time, na.rm= TRUE))
```

#### Computing summary values

* [`summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html): reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

Can be used with any code that returns only one value, such as `mean()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, etc.

```{r}
survey %>% 
  summarise(avg_travel_time = mean(travel_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```

What is the median time people spend on facebook and twitter?
```{r}
survey %>% 
  summarise(social_hours = median(hours_facebook + hours_twitter, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Operating in groups

* [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html): perform future operations in groups.

A super powerful feature of `dplyr` for data manipulation! Apply future `dplyr` functions on various different groups.

Is the average travel time different between travel type?

```{r}
survey %>% 
  group_by(travel_method) %>% 
  summarise(avg_travel_time = mean(travel_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
survey %>% 
  group_by(degree_type, uni_year) %>% 
  summarise(total = n())
```

#### The power is in your hands!

![](images/power.webp)


#### Use this power wisely :)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  filter(row_number() %in% sample(seq_len(n()), size = n()/2))

# Or more simply with a shortcut:
survey %>% 
  sample_frac(0.5)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  sample_frac(0.5)
```

## String manipulation

### [**stringr**](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) ![](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/logo.png){width="10%" height="10%"}

The `stringr` package provide a set of functions help you easier to working with strings.

#### What can ![](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/logo.png){width="6%" height="6%"} do?

**All functions** in stringr **start with** `str_` and take a vector of strings as the first argument.

Eight useful functions:

* [`str_detect(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_detect.html): tells you if there’s any match to the pattern.

* [`str_count(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_count.html): counts the number of patterns.

* [`str_subset(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_subset.html): extracts the matching components.

* [`str_locate(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_locate.html): gives the position of the match.

* [`str_extract(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_extract.html): extracts the text of the match.

* [`str_match(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_match.html): extracts parts of the match defined by parentheses.

* [`str_replace(x, pattern,` replacement)](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_replace.html): replaces the matches with new text.

* [`str_split(x, pattern)`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html): splits up a string into multiple pieces.


#### What is a pattern?

![https://xkcd.com/208/](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png){width="75%"}

A pattern is a friendly word for "regular expression". It is a language for extracting sections of text from a document.
