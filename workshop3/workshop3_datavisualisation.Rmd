## Introduction to data visualisation

### Load the packages 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(learnr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(readr)
```

An interesting chocolate data set with diverse ingredients in chocolates. Firstly, library `readr` and then use `read_csv()` function to import the chocolate data set. (The data was originally collected by scraping the nutritional details available at the manufacturers web sites.)

```{r}
library(readr)
chocolates <- read_csv("data/chocolates.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
chocolates <- chocolates %>%
  mutate(Contain_Chol = ifelse(Chol_mg > 0, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(Type = factor(Type))
```

* Different chocolates in rows are our observations and the columns (variables) store information about different aspects of the chocolates.

* Our variables include fiber, fat, calories countries and etc...

```{r}
head(chocolates) 
```

* Use `glimpse()` function to have a look at our data type relative to different variables; The dimension of the data can be seen at the top left 

* You can also use `dim()` function to know the dimension of the data: 88 observations and 15 variables 

* Use `names()` to see the relevant variables  

* Data type: character, factor, double and logical 

```{r}
glimpse(chocolates) 
dim(chocolates)
names(chocolates)
```

### Make a plot by using chocolate data 

* Use `ggplot()` to visualize the data  

* Change the title and the name of x axis by using `ggtitle()` and `xlab()`

```{r plot1}
ggplot(data = chocolates, aes(x = Sugars_g, y = Calories, color = Type)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("The relationship between calories and sugars relative to chocolate types") +
  xlab("Sugars")
```

### Now let's improve it

One problem with the default colour scheme is that when only two colours are needed, the two are not colour blind proof. This means that these two colours look the same for a person with the common red/green colour blindness.

We can change the default colour palette pretty easily.

```{r plot1b}
ggplot(data = chocolates, aes(x = Sugars_g, y = Calories, color = Type)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("The relationship between calories and sugars relative to chocolate types") +
  xlab("Sugars") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## Scatter plot

* Using function `geom_point()` in the `ggplot2` package 

* Using mtcars as our data 

### What is mtcars?

* Motor Trend Car Road Tests -- the data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

* Use `help()` function to find more information 

* Important variables: 
    + mpg -- Miles/(US) gallon
    + cyl -- Number of cylinders
    + wt -- Weight (1000 lbs)
    + vs -- Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
    + am -- Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
    + hp -- Gross horsepower
    
```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

### Simple point plot 

The graph indicates that the cars with lower weight tend to use less petrol.

```{r plot2}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Color with discrete variable

* Use `factor()` to make `cyl` as a factor 

* `color` is in the `aes()` function 

* The function `labs()` can be used to easily update the legend title for a given aesthetic (fill, color, size, shape, line type, …)

* We can also change the text color and position of the legend as well

The graph shows the miles that cars travel per gallon of gasoline depending on the number of the cylinders they have. Heavy cars tend to have more cylinders and travel fewer distances than light cars with the same amount of gasoline. 

```{r plot3}
p1 <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "cyl") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")

p2 <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "cyl") +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.title = element_text(color = "blue", size = 10, face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "blue", size = 10, face = "bold")) + 
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

### Color with continuous variable

#### Question: What kind of car tends to have high horsepower?

`scale_color_gradient()` for sequential gradients between two colors

```{r plot4}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = hp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "hp") +
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Using a fixed point color 

```{r plot5}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Mapping a variable to point shapes

```{r plot6}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, shape = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(shape = "cyl") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Mapping a variable to point sizes

```{r plot7}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, size = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(size = "cyl") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Mapping a variable to point transparency

```{r plot8}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, alpha = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(alpha = "cyl") +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

### Combining color and shape 

```{r plot9}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, shape = factor(am), color = hp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per gallon", color = "Gross horsepower") +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Transmission", labels = c("automatic", "manual")) +
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red")
```

* Generally, using colour for one variable, and shape for another makes a very difficult to read plot. This is what you see here, its difficult to learn anything from the plot because there is too much to digest.

### Adding a vertical line 

```{r plot10}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3) +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3, linetype = "dotted", 
             color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles/(US) gallon")
```

## Line graph 

### Simple line graph

* Using `mpg` as our data frame and use `help()` function to get more information 

* Fuel economy data from 1999 and 2008 for 38 popular models of car

* Using function `geom_line()`

```{r plot11}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Engine Displacement (Litres)") +
  ylab("Highway Miles per Gallon")
```

For this data, the line plot doesn't make much sense. A more usual example is to make a time series plot, like this one below.

```{r plot11b}
data(economics)
ggplot(data=economics, aes(x=date, y=pce)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("personal consumption ($bil)")
```

## Faceting 

### Using `facet_wrap()`

By using faceting, we can clearly identify the features of cars with different number of cylinders. 

```{r plot12}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~cyl)
```

### Using `facet_grid()`

Add facets categorized by multiple variables

```{r plot13}
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  facet_grid(cyl ~ am)
```

## Box plot, histogram, bar chart

### Box plot 

* Change the background by using `theme_bw()` function 

* Add color corresponding to `drv` 

* f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

```{r plot14}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```

### Histogram 

* Using `binwidth()` to adjust the width of each bin  

* we only need y axis in the `aes()` 

```{r plot15}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.6) 
```

Changing the binwidth for the bars is important for making a histogram. Using 1 for the binwidth is more reasonable for this data, because `hwy` is provided as an integer.

```{r plot15b}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 
```


### Bar chart

A barchart and a histogram walked into a bar, and no-one could tell them apart! They are not identical twins, but rather fraternal. A bar chart is used for a categorical variable, and typically has a gap between bars indicating that there is a gap between measurements. Histograms are used for continuous measurements, and you need to decide on an appropriate binning strategy to make a good one.

```{r plot16}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=hwy)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

Funnily enough, because `hwy` is an integer, the barchart of it is the same as the histogram with binwidth=1.

Better to use a categorical variable to show off a barchart.

```{r plot16b}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=class)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

### Count of `drv` in bar chart 

```{r plot17}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=class, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

### Compositional bar charts

When cars are moving using front wheels on highway, they tend to drive more miles per gallon instead of using all 4 wheels or only rear wheels.

```{r plot18}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=class, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

### Side-by-side bar charts 

When cars are moving on the highway, they are more likely to use 4 wheels or just front wheels. 

```{r plot19}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=class, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## Advanced plotting 

### Non-linear regression 

* Using span to control the "willingness" of the default loess smoother.

* The span is the fraction of points used to fit each local regression.

* Small numbers make a wigglier curve, larger numbers make a smoother curve.

```{r plot21}
p3 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

p4 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.3)

grid.arrange(p3, p4, nrow = 1)
```

### Set `se = FALSE` to get rid of standard error

```{r plot22}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.3, se = FALSE)
```

### Scatter plot Matrices 

* All variables are supposed to be numerical 

* Rotate the text of x axis in order to be seen clearly 

```{r plot23}
library(GGally)
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(am = factor(am)) %>% 
  ggscatmat(data=.,color = "am", columns=c(1,3,4,5,6,7)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
